# ProbabilisticProgramming-BayesianNeuralNetworks

## Description
This is a project for **Probabilistic Programming** course in *Artificial Intelligence Master* course of FMI Unibuc. It's supposed to 
cover the following points:
- how to best quantify the uncertainty in predictions and propose a method (ex: entropy)
- classification with novel classes, were one class is left out for training and then predict on it (using a bayesian neural network and classical)
- use a bayesian neural network for a nonlinear regression problem and use uncertainty to detect if a point is in extrapolation region
For more information, the documentation is attached to the rest of the files.

## The stack:
- Python as the overall PL in Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplot, Tensorflow, PYMC data exploration and training

## Installation
1. Above the list of files, click <>Code.
2. Copy the desired URL for the repository (HTTPS, SSH), or use Github CLI.
3. Open Git Bash on your machine.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory:
    ```bash
        cd <workdir_name>
    ```
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier:
    ```bash
        git clone <copied_URL>
    ```
6. Run the notebook on a `Jupyter Server`, or watch the existing results

## Final Note
Not much to show in terms of visuals of GUI. This was more of a research project were
documentation was the most important. Advice: given a problem/topic, expect to wait some 
time for sampling and try to think and structure the data, or modify the target acceptance
to allow chains to converge.
